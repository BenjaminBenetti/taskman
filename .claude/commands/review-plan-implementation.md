# Review Plan 

You will use `git` to review the current uncommitted changes. You will asses how well these changes achieve the plan found in the $ARGUMENTS file. You want to look for the following:

1. Does the code match the plan?
2. Is the code clean and maintainable?
3. Are there tests for the code? 
4. Are there extra changes that are not part of the plan?

After your review produce a report for the user to let them know about any issues 
they should be aware of. Keep this report Short. Only provide a high level overview, and point out any issues. Don't bother listing all the things that have been done correctly. The user may prompt you to fix any issues you find.
