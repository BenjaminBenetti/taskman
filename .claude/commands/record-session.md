# How to Record a Session

Record a summary of the tasks you just performed to the `summary.md`. This should be a high level summary to inform the user of the changes made. Include any relevant context or details that would help the user understand the modifications.

# Summary Template 
The summary must follow this very simple template

## <title> - <date>
<summary>

### For example:

## Add new endpoint /help - 2023-10-05-10:00
Updated the backend to include a new `/help` endpoint that provides assistance with common issues. This endpoint is now accessible via the main application interface.
