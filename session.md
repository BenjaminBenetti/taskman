## TRPC Integration for Backend - 2025-07-20
Replaced the Oak HTTP server with TRPC v11.4.3 to enable type-safe API communication between backend and CLI. Set up basic TRPC router structure with Zod v4.0.5 for input validation. Created modular file structure with separate router and initialization files. Configured backend module exports via mod.ts to expose `taskmanRouter` and TypeScript types for CLI consumption. The backend now serves TRPC endpoints on port 8000, replacing the previous hello world endpoint.
