# Start the backend and database
docker-compose up --build

# Backend runs on http://localhost:8000
```

## Development

The project is in early development. Current status:
- âœ… Backend scaffolding with TRPC
- âœ… Docker setup for development
- ðŸš§ Core API implementation
- ðŸ“‹ CLI client (not started)
